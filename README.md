### High level Overview of Deliverables (milestone2)
- a doctor can record a video and upload it
- the video is analysed and posture and elements are extracted from that video and stored in db
- on the patient side, they can view the reference video of themselves
- they then start performing the exercise and through their webcam, a pose estimation model can ensure that the poses they are doing right now are correct. If they're not correct, show an error through text


- react native + expo 

**Very important** : open the `src` folder in vscode, not the parent `physiotherapy-guidance-system` to avoid confusions
